### Overview

This is the property micro-frontend for the MTFH project. This app is not intended to be
run in isolation in production, but managed through it's
[root app](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/mtfh-frontend-root).

The values can be found in the development AWS account in the Parameter Store (eu-west-2).

### Development of new features and E2E tests

Part of writing a new feature for this repository involves ensuring that the pipeline
`mtfh-tl-e2e-tests` will pass in Circle CI, even if you do not modify or add tests (which
you should).

Failure to do this will result in:

- Less test coverage for MMH, adding tech debt, and all other disadvantages that come with
  untested code;
- The mtfh-tl-e2e-tests pipeline may end up being BLOCKED by any changes made to MMH,
  which could affect other developers and ALL future releases on ALL micro-frontends;
